***canvasXpress.data*** is the source of data files used in visual/shiny examples and tests in the canvasXpress R package


***canvasXpress*** was developed as the core visualization component for bioinformatics and systems biology analysis
at Bristol-Myers Squibb. It supports a large number of [visualizations ](http://www.canvasxpress.org/examples.html) 
to display scientific and non-scientific data. ***canvasXpress*** also includes a simple and unobtrusive 
[user interface](http://www.canvasxpress.org/docs/interface.html) to explore complex data sets -- data can
be easily sorted, grouped, transposed, transformed or clustered dynamically.  The canvasXpress R package is available on 
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=canvasXpress) and [GitHub](https://github.com/neuhausi/canvasXpress).
